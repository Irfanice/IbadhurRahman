Any one can read Quran beacause: 
“This is the book, in it is guidance for sure without doubt, to those who fear Allah”. (2:2)
“A Book We have sent down to you so that you may bring forth mankind from the darkness into the light......”. (14:1)
"a guidance for mankind and clear evidence of guidance and discrimination (between wrong)”. (2:185).
“and We have revealed the Book to you explaining clearly everything" (16:89).
And So on.....

Read it, think about it, and seek guidance
